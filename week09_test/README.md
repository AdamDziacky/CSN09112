# Test 1
You will answer the questions with either fixed answers, short explainations or with multiple choice. The test is a closed book test. Note there will be no lectures in Week 9.

Time for test: Thursday, 4 November 2021. Time: 65 mins. 

Time slots: 29 July 2022 (Time to be arranged).

Requirements: 

* An active Internet connection to access Moodle. 
* An active webcam and microphone. You will be asked to enable your Webcam, but disable your microphone. If you have any questions, we will move you to a break-out room to discuss.
* If possible, spin-up your Kali instance for it to be ready to be used.

YouTube introduction to test: [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAiqUot5Dao).

## Background

* Ciphers and Fundamentals [Link](https://github.com/billbuchanan/csn09112/tree/master/week04_ciphers).
* Symmetric Encryption/Hashing [Link](https://github.com/billbuchanan/csn09112/tree/master/week05_secretkey)
* Public key. [Link](https://github.com/billbuchanan/csn09112/tree/master/week06_public_key/lecture)
* Key Exchange. [Link](https://github.com/billbuchanan/csn09112/tree/master/week06_public_key/lecture)

## Test 1 (Examples)

* Rail Code [Try](https://asecuritysite.com/coding/rail).
* Caeser. [Try](https://asecuritysite.com/tests/tests?sortBy=caesar).
* Hex. [Try](https://asecuritysite.com/tests/tests?sortBy=hex01).
* Binary to ASCII. [Try](https://asecuritysite.com/tests/tests?sortBy=ascii02). 

## Test 1 (Some principles)

* Key Enthropy [here](https://asecuritysite.com/encryption/en). How many bits can represent X phases? Just take the Log(X), and divide by Log (2).
* John the Ripper, Hashcat and Ophcrack: [here](http://youtu.be/Xvbk2nSzEPk?t=14m17s)
* Using OpenSSL to salt passwords: [here](http://youtu.be/Xvbk2nSzEPk?t=4m58s)

## Study Questions

Try to review your knowledge by answering these questions:

* Can you convert characters from one format to another, such as in binary, hex, ASCII and Base-64 (remember: hex uses four bits at a time, and Base-64 uses six bits at a time)?
* Do you know the basic theory of converting a bit stream into Base-64 (remember 6 bits at a time and convert from table)?
* Do you understand how to use some key ciphers, including shifted alphabet, scrambled alphabet, Vigenere, Pigpen and rail codes?
* Can you do a simple Diffie-Hellman calculation and end up with the same shared key?
* Do you understand how the number of keys relate to the security of the ciphers?
* Can you work out key enthropy, so that if you have 2,048 phases, you can calculate that this is equivalent to 11 bits [log(2048)/log(2)]?
* Would you know how long it would take to crack a code next year, if it takes 10 years now, and computing power doubles each year?
* Do you understand how public and private key encryption is used, along with the usage of digital certificates?
* Do you understand the conversion of passwords into hashed passwords, and use tools such as John The Ripper, Hashcat, Ophcrack and OpenSSL?
