**Supervised Artificial Neural Network for Intrusion Detection**
 by Dr. Sana Ullah Jan

Objective: Implement and analyse performance of Supervised Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for intrusion detection.

Dataset: A subset of CIC-IDS2017 dataset will be provided to students (available on https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html [Accessed on 27/10/2021]).

Exercise: Vary the input parameters of ANN to see the effect on its performance.

Platform: Google Colab (https://colab.research.google.com).
