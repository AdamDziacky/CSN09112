In windows command prompt, "Chmod" has an alternative "icacls" (the updated version of cacls) command to change permissions

# Reset to remove explict permissions
icacls.exe $path /reset
# Give current user explicit read-permission
icacls.exe $path /GRANT:R "$($env:USERNAME):(R)"
# Disable inheritance and remove inherited permissions
icacls.exe $path /inheritance:r
