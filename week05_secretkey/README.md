# Unit 5: Secret (Symmetric) Key and Hashing

## Objectives


The key concepts are: Understanding symmetric key encryption and hashing methods.

## Symmetric key

### What you should know at the end of unit?

* The differences between a stream cipher and a block cipher
* How salting is used to change the cipher blocks.
* Use openssl to perform practical operations.
* Understand the encoding formats used for cipher text and keys.

### Presentations

* Presentation (PDF) - Symmetric Key Encryption: <a href="https://github.com/billbuchanan/csn09112/blob/master/week05_secretkey/lecture/chapter02_secret.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>
 * Presentation (video) - Symmetric Key Encryption and Padding: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRV34K3xIo&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">here</a>

### Tests

* Test (Symmetric Key Encryption): <a href="https://asecuritysite.com/tests/tests?sortBy=cryptobook02" target="_blank">here</a> 

### Addendum

In the lecture, at the end of Symmetric Key lecture, the table should be:

## Hashing
### What you should know at the end of unit?

* How the lengths of the hashes vary with the number of bits in the hash.
* How we can calculate the strengths on passwords.
* Understand how salt is applied to the hashing process
* Define how collisions can occur within hashing.
* Implement hash cracking methods (John the Ripper and Hashcat).
* Defines the usage of signed hashes (eg HMAC).
* Outlines the usage of OTP and Timed Passwords.
